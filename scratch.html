		<h1>Name Assignment</h1>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p><img src="images/nameAssignment.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>
		<p>Use scratch to design and create a program that shows my name. The requirements were to use a sprite for each letter in my name and give them 3 unique behaviors. The program needed to run when the green flag was clicked and for extra credit I added a function to reset the scene to the beginning each time the green flag was clicked.</p>
		<h2>Concepts learned</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Using event blocks- specifically green flag clicked and when I receive message</li>
			<li>Used loops-forever loops to constantly switch costumes</li>
			<li>Movement- I used movement blocks to move the letters around the screen and spin some letters</li>
			<li>Looks- used looks blocks to change costumes and size</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Computer Buying Project</h1>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p><img src="images/computerBuyingProject.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>
		<p>
		Description: In this project, we had to find a few computer options for a specific person that we interviewed. We also had to list and have a description of the computer parts. In the end, we had to pick one computer and explain why we chose it. We chose the Dell XPS as the winner for Salahâ€™s dad.
		</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>Control blocks- used if statements with sensing blocks inside so that the slide changed every time the space bar was clicked</li>
		<li>Used costumes to change each slide</li>
		<li>Used go to blocks to center the sprites in each slide</li>
		
		<h1>Scratch Final Project</h1>
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p><img src="FinalProject.jpg" width="400" height="300"></p>
		<p>Description: For the final project, we could either make a story or a game. I made a game and the requirements were that you had to be able to win, there had to be a score, there had to be a timer, multiple levels, and the levels had to be more challenging as time goes on.</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>Variables for velocity</li>
		<li>How to make a timer that counts down by using a variable</li>
		<li>Used loops to make an enemy spaceship go after you forever</li>
		<li>Used if blocks to make the enemy shoot if they were within a certain range</li>
